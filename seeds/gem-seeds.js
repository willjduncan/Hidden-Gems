    title: "Pilot Mountain State Park",
    description: "Located in Surry and Yadkin counties 20 miles northwest of Winston-Salem, Pilot Mountain State Park centers around the iconic geologic knob that serves as a beacon to the surrounding Piedmont, inviting outdoor enthusiasts to a vast array of activities. Once a navigational landmark for the Saura tribe, the Big Pinnacle can be viewed from the park's summit area, which also provides panoramic views of the Piedmont and the Sauratown and Blue Ridge mountains. Trails take hikers around the mountain base, up Little Pinnacle, and along the Yadkin River. The park also offers bridle trails along the trail corridor connecting the mountain and river sections. Rock climbing and rappelling are allowed on portions of the park's steep cliffs. The lower slopes of Pilot Mountain offer tent and trailer camping, while the river section has two paddle-in campsites for nights along the river. Two of North Carolina's state trails traverse the park: the Mountains-to-Sea State Trail, as well as the Yadkin River paddle trail. A new visitor center with exhibits that focus on the natural and cultural history of the area augment the park's educational programs.",
